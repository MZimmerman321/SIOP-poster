		"abstract": "This study empirically synthesizes and evaluates studies that have examined the relation between vocationally relevant domains of self-eﬃcacy and interests. We conducted a meta-analytic review of 60 empirical independent samples (N ¼ 39,154) in which relations between selfeﬃcacy and interests had been examined. Fifty-three of these samples (N ¼ 37,829) included parallel measures of the constructs. Relations between parallel measures of HollandÕs RIASEC themes, the speciﬁc dimensions of art, math, science and math/science combined, and traditionally female and male occupations are also presented. Results demonstrated that self-eﬃcacy and interests are independent constructs that correlate moderately. Diﬀerences by sex, measure, and age group are noted. Future directions for research regarding links between self-eﬃcacy and interests are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Invited commentary on Armstrong and Vogel’s (2009) article on interpreting the interest– efficacy association stimulated an appraisal from a broader perspective. Like empirical research, scale development, and theorizing emanating from social cognitive career theory (SCCT), their conclusion about the importance of assessing both interests and self-efficacy in applied settings and speculations about the developmental sequencing of these attributes need to be evaluated in the context of what decades of longitudinal research reveal are critical determinants of educational and vocational choice, performance after choice, and persistence. For our interventions to be effective and our theory development to be meaningful, we must ensure that innovative measures possess incremental validity relative to cognitive abilities and educational–vocational interests, which are already well established as salient predictors of long-term educational–vocational outcomes. Broader historical, philosophical, and scientific perspectives are provided to enhance practice, research, and theory development. These broader perspectives reveal how well-positioned vocational counseling is for further advances if it builds on (rather than neglects) its longstanding tradition of developing a cumulative psychological science.",

		"abstract": "The current article replies to comments made by Lent, Sheu, and Brown (2010) and Lubinski (2010) regarding the study “Interpreting the Interest–Efficacy Association From a RIASEC Perspective” (Armstrong & Vogel, 2009). The comments made by Lent et al. and Lubinski highlight a number of important theoretical and methodological issues, including the process of defining and differentiating between constructs, the assumptions underlying Holland’s (1959, 1997) RIASEC (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional types) model and interrelations among constructs specified in social cognitive career theory (SCCT), the importance of incremental validity for evaluating constructs, and methodological considerations when quantifying interest– efficacy correlations and for comparing models using multivariate statistical methods. On the basis of these comments and previous research on the SCCT and Holland models, we highlight the importance of considering multiple theoretical perspectives in vocational research and practice. Alternative structural models are outlined for examining the role of interests, self-efficacy, learning experiences, outcome expectations, personality, and cognitive abilities in the career choice and development process.",
