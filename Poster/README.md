The RMD file is for the poster code. 

The html file is what the last knited poster looks like. If changes were made locally, need to push knited file to master for html to update. Only changing code will not change the html so changes may not look like they did anything. 

Images file is where I currentlly have the placeholeder images. 

The mz_poster_files folder is output. (If there was any)


Main package used to format the poster is [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki) 

# To Do
- Need to add in the data tables. Which ones do we want? I do not have the final r-file that made the tables used for the siop write up. 
   - Do you also have a zotero libary? For references included on the poster. 
   - I'd like to include a SCCT flowchart and the basic RIASEC structure picture. Is there any that you are aware of that are used for posters? If not I can find. 
- Right now I just have the radar plot image from the original poster. I would like to make a better one. 
- Clean up the text of the poster
  -It is definitly too wordy atm. If I add the pictures then it will definintily get a bit congested. 
    - clean up any design problems. 
      - I would like to move the middle text in the center a bit higher.
