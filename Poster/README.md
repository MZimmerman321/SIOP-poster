The RMD file is for the poster code. 

The html file is what the last knited poster looks like. If changes were made locally, need to push knited file to master for html to update. Only changing code will not change the html so changes may not look like they did anything. 

Images file is where I currentlly have the placeholeder images. 

The mz_poster_files folder is output. (If there was any)
