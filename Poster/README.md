The RMD file is for the poster code. 

Images file is where I currentlly have the placeholeder images. 

The mz_poster_files folder is output. (If there was any)


Main package used to format the poster is [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki) 

# To Do
Last things:

- Citatiations and captions, first one is not captioned correctly 

- Formatting of center image. Will it let me mark it as a figure??? That graph is not easier to read if I make it lol. fix the text size and error bar highlighting. 

- Seperate text from body and main sections better. 

- Make the model fit data into a table and make sure numbers are all correct. 

- GRAMMER and SPELLCHECK 
   - also file make sure file size is correct.
