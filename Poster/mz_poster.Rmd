#
- Interactions between interests (**I**) and self-efficacy (**SE**) are used to predict domain relevant career paths.

```{r, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, fig.cap= 'Social Cognitive Career Theory model adopted from Lent et al., 1994', fig.height=3.5, out.width="90%" }
knitr::include_graphics("images/scct.jpg")
```
- **SE** is a precursor to **I** development, implying the two constructs are ‘related but distinct’. [@lentUnifyingSocialCognitive1994]
- Previous meta-analytic results have found strong mean correlations between the two. [@rottinghausRelationSelfefficacyInterests2003]
- Existing heterogeneity is attributed to tangible differences between the constructs. 

    - But is it more likely that this is due to method effects?
    
# Objectives

- Illuminate potential measurement artefacts between I and SE measures by: 
    1. Determining convergence between I and SE measures. 
    2. Analyzing the structure of cross method correlations.
    3. Using multi-trait multi-method (MMTM) factor analysis for each construct

# Methods
- An exhaustive literature search resulted in 292 studies with unique samples made up of 834,087 people. 
- Correlations were calculated using the R package psychmeta. 
- The MMTM analysis: a correlated-traits, correlated-uniqueness (CTCU) model was fit to a synthetic meta-analytic correlation matrix constructed to reflect meta-analytic mean observed (not corrected for unreliability) correlations among:
   1. Typical RIASEC interest scales
   2. Typical RIASEC self-efficacy scales
   3. RIASEC interest scales drawn from a different inventories
- To account for method variance the uniqueness's for the six scales from the same method to co-vary.
- Confidence intervals, were found through the harmonic mean sample size across included correlations.


# Results


```{r, echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fig.cap= 'Latent variable factor loadings for correlated trait–correlated uniqueness CFA model', fig.height=3.5, out.width="70%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/factor_loadings.jpg")

```

- The model showed moderate fit: 

    - Comparative fit index = 0.943 
    - Root mean square error of approximation = 0.092 [0.089,0.096]  
    - Mean absolute residual correlation = 0.042 

- Only sources of misfit were modest overestimates of correlations among select self-efficacy scales and between select self-efficacy scales anddifferent-inventory interest scales.
