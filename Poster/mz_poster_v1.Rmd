# Introduction

- Interactions between interests (**I**) and self-efficacy (**SE**), modeled by social cognitive carreer theory (SSCT), are used to predict domain relevent carreer paths. 
- **SE** is a precursor to **I** development, implying the two constructs are ‘related but distinct’. 

![SCCT Flowchart?](images\placeholder4.jpg)

- Previous meta-analytic results have found strong mean correlations between the two. Exsisting heterogeneity is attributed to tangible differences between the constructs. 
- Specfically, SE is capturing specific orientations toward work activities that interest measures alone can not capture.

# Objectives

- Illumintate potential measurement artefacts between I and SE measures by: 
   1. Determining convergence between I and SE measures. 
   2. Analyzing the structre of cross method corrallations.
   3. Using multi-trait multi-method (MMTM) factor analysis for each construct

![RIASEC Hexagon](images\placeholder5.jpg)

- The structure of RIASEC interests is represented as a hexagon.
- If SE is tangibly different from I in this context, its structure orintation should be capturing more information than an I measure alone. 

# Methods

- An exhaustive literature search resulted in 292 studies with unique samples made up of 834,087 people. 
- Correlations were calculated using the R package psychmeta. 
- The MMTM analysis a correlated-traits, correlated-uniqueness (CTCU) model was fit to a synthetic meta-analytic correlation matrix constructed to reflect meta-analytic mean observed (not corrected for unreliability) correlations among:
   1. Typical RIASEC interest scales
   2. Typical RIASEC self-efficacy scales
   3. RIASEC interest scales drawn from a different inventories
- To account for method variance the uniqueness's for the six scales from the same method to covary.
- Confidence intervals, were found through the harmonic mean sample size across included correlations.
