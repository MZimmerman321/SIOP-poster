  {"id":"lentUnifyingSocialCognitive1994","abstract":"Develops social cognitive models of interest development, choice, and performance in career development. The framework is derived primarily from A. Bandura's (1986) general social cognitive theory. It emphasizes the means by which individuals exercise personal agency in the career development process, as well as extrapersonal factors that enhance or constrain agency. The focus is on self-efficacy, expected outcome, and goal mechanisms and how they may interrelate with other person (e.g., gender), contextual (e.g., support system), and experiential/learning factors. 12 sets of propositions are offered to organize existing findings and guide future research on the theory. A meta-analysis of relevant findings illustrates how hypothesized relations have been charted in past research. A proposed research agenda includes testing of the models and model comparisons and integrations. Theory expansion is also discussed.","author":[{"family":"Lent","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Steven D."},{"family":"Hackett","given":"Gail"}],"container-title":"Journal of vocational behavior","container-title-short":"JVB","DOI":"10/bpdwrw","ISSN":"0001-8791(Print)","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"language":"en","page":"79-122","source":"APA PsycNET","title":"Toward a unifying social cognitive theory of career and academic interest, choice, and performance","type":"article-journal","volume":"45"}
